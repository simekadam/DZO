function [t_2D, t_separable] = filtering_times(im, sigmas)
% function [t_2D, t_separable] = filtering_times(im, sigmas)
% IM: an M-by-N matrix of class double
% SIGMAS: a 1-by-K vector storing sigmas of Gaussian filters.
% This function takes one sigma after another, and for each one:
%    * it filters the image with a 2D Gaussian kernel of a given sigma
%    * it filters the image with two separable 1D Gaussian kernels of a given sigma
%
% For each sigma, this function records the time needed for the filtering using
% a 2D Gaussian, and using the separable kernels. The timings are stored in
% t_2D and t_separable, respectively.
% Thus t_2D and t_separable are 1-by-K vectors.
